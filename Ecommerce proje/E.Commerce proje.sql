--CUSTOMER RETENTION ANALYSIS



--1. Create a view that keeps visit logs of customers on a monthly basis. (For each log, three field is kept: Cust_id, Year, Month)
--Use such date functions. Don't forget to call up columns you might need later.

CREATE VIEW customer_of_logs AS

SELECT	cust_id,
		YEAR (ORDER_DATE) [YEAR],
		MONTH (ORDER_DATE) [MONTH]
FROM	combined_table

ORDER BY 1,2,3 desc


--//////////////////////////////////


--2. Create a view that keeps the number of monthly visits by users. (Separately for all months from the business beginning)
--Don't forget to call up columns you might need later.

CREATE VIEW monthly_of_visits AS

SELECT	Cust_id, [YEAR], [MONTH], COUNT(*) NUM_OF_LOG
FROM	customer_logs
GROUP BY Cust_id, [YEAR], [MONTH]




--//////////////////////////////////


--3. For each visit of customers, create the next month of the visit as a separate column.
--You can number the months with "DENSE_RANK" function.
--then create a new column for each month showing the next month using the numbering you have made. (use "LEAD" function.)
--Don't forget to call up columns you might need later.

CREATE VIEW NEXT_of_VISIT AS 
SELECT *,
		LEAD(CURRENT_MONTH ) OVER (PARTITION BY Cust_id ORDER BY CURRENT_MONTH) NEXT_VISIT_MONTH
FROM 
(
SELECT  *,
		DENSE_RANK () OVER (ORDER BY [YEAR] , [MONTH]) CURRENT_MONTH
		
FROM	monthly_of_visits
) A

with t1 as (
				select distinct Cust_id, Order_Date, year(order_date)yýl,month(Order_Date) ziyaret_ayý
				from Combined_table
				)
select *,lead(t1.ziyaret_ayý) over(partition by t1.Cust_id order by Order_Date) birsonraki_ziyaret_ayý
from t1
--/////////////////////////////////



--4. Calculate the monthly time gap between two consecutive visits by each customer.
--Don't forget to call up columns you might need later.

CREATE VIEW time_gaps AS

SELECT *,
		NEXT_VISIT_MONTH - CURRENT_MONTH time_gaps
FROM	NEXT_of_VISIT





--/////////////////////////////////////////


--5.Categorise customers using time gaps. Choose the most fitted labeling model for you.
--  For example: 
--	Labeled as churn if the customer hasn't made another purchase in the months since they made their first purchase.
--	Labeled as regular if the customer has made a purchase every month.
--  Etc.



SELECT * FROM time_gaps
where Cust_id = 'Cust_873'


SELECT cust_id, avg_time_gap,
		CASE WHEN avg_time_gap = 1 THEN 'retained' 
			WHEN avg_time_gap > 1 THEN 'irregular'
			WHEN avg_time_gap IS NULL THEN 'Churn'
			ELSE 'UNKNOWN DATA' END CUST_LABELS
FROM
		(
		SELECT Cust_id, AVG(time_gaps) avg_time_gap
		FROM	time_gaps
		GROUP BY Cust_id
		) A

--MONTH-WÝSE RETENTÝON RATE


--Find month-by-month customer retention rate  since the start of the business.


--1. Find the number of customers retained month-wise. (You can use time gaps)
--Use Time Gaps

SELECT	DISTINCT cust_id, [YEAR],
		[MONTH],
		CURRENT_MONTH,
		NEXT_VISIT_MONTH,
		time_gaps,
		COUNT (cust_id)	OVER (PARTITION BY NEXT_VISIT_MONTH) RETENTITON_MONTH_WISE
FROM	time_gaps
where	time_gaps =1
ORDER BY cust_id, YEAR,MONTH



CREATE VIEW CNT_RETAINED_CUST AS
SELECT *, COUNT(cust_id) OVER (PARTITION BY NEXT_VISIT_MONTH) CNT_RETAINED_CUST
FROM TIME_GAPS
WHERE TIME_GAPS = 1
SELECT * FROM CNT_RETAINED_CUST
CREATE VIEW CNT_TOTAL_CUST AS
SELECT *, COUNT (cust_id) OVER (PARTITION BY CURRENT_MONTH) CNT_TOTAL_CUST
FROM TIME_GAPS
WHERE CURRENT_MONTH > 1
SELECT * FROM CNT_TOTAL_CUST WHERE TIME_GAPS = 1
--//////////////////////


--2. Calculate the month-wise retention rate.

--Basic formula: o	Month-Wise Retention Rate = 1.0 * Total Number of Customers in The Previous Month / Number of Customers Retained in The Next Nonth

--It is easier to divide the operations into parts rather than in a single ad-hoc query. It is recommended to use View. 
--You can also use CTE or Subquery if you want.

--You should pay attention to the join type and join columns between your views or tables.

CREATE VIEW CURRENT_NUM_OF_CUST AS

SELECT	DISTINCT cust_id, [YEAR],
		[MONTH],
		CURRENT_MONTH,
		COUNT (cust_id)	OVER (PARTITION BY CURRENT_MONTH) CURR_CUST
FROM	time_gaps


SELECT *
FROM	CURRENT_NUM_OF_CUST

---
CREATE VIEW NEXT_NUM_OF_CUST AS

SELECT	DISTINCT cust_id, [YEAR],
		[MONTH],
		CURRENT_MONTH,
		NEXT_VISIT_MONTH,
		COUNT (cust_id)	OVER (PARTITION BY Current_Month) NEXT_CUST
FROM	time_gaps
WHERE	time_gaps = 1
AND		CURRENT_MONTH > 1



SELECT DISTINCT
		B.[YEAR],
		B.[MONTH],
		B.CURRENT_MONTH,
		1.0 * B.NEXT_CUST / A.CURR_CUST RETENTION_RATE
FROM	CURRENT_NUM_OF_CUST A LEFT JOIN NEXT_NUM_OF_CUST B
ON		A.CURRENT_MONTH + 1 = B.NEXT_VISIT_MONTH
